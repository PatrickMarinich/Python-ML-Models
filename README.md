ML models written in python

All of the files are different ML models written in python which accomplish different tasks

1. Handwritten Numbers AI, MNIST Data - Published December 2021, Accurary 98-99%
2. Maleria Detector Model (Final Team 3 Project), MINST Data - Written November 2021, Accuracy 94%


Info
1. The Handwritten Numbers AI code was written as My first ever intro to ML Model coding. The Model Size was insspired by the 3Blue1Brown video on the subject. It uses the handwritten numbers from MINST and the goal of the Model was for it to determine what number was written within the image.  

2. Written for a Big Th!nk AI competition at UMD, My partner and I experimented with different sized models with different activation functions, The size that we chose was the best that we could figure out within the alloted time frame and therefore many not be optimized. To score accuracy we used a confusion matrix to differentate between true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. An accuracy rating of 94% was able to get us second place in the winter 2021 semester competition.
